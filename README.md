# Belly Button Biodiversity 

https://bmilne64.github.io/Belly-Button-Biodiversity/

In this project, I built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

First, I used the D3 library to read in samples.json from the URL. 

Then, I created a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual (ID number) and a bubble chart that displays each sample.

Finally, I displayed the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information as key-value pairs in a chart on the page.
